    <h2>Description</h2>
<p><strong>Wheat pancakes</strong> are a type of pancake made from wheat flour, water, and salt. They have a denser and coarser texture compared to regular pancakes, with a nuttier and earthier flavor due to the use of whole wheat flour. They are often cooked on a griddle or frying pan and can be served with a variety of toppings like butter, syrup, honey, fruit, or even savory options like eggs or cheese.</p>

<p>These pancakes are a popular choice for breakfast or brunch due to their hearty and wholesome nature. They are often preferred by those seeking a slightly healthier alternative to traditional pancakes, as whole wheat flour retains more nutrients and fiber. Some recipes may include additional ingredients like baking powder for fluffiness or spices for extra flavor. Wheat pancakes are a delicious and versatile option for starting the day.</p>
