    <h3>Description:</h3>

    <p>
      <strong>Egg fried rice</strong> is a classic dish featuring stir-fried
      rice combined with scrambled eggs, vegetables, and seasonings. Itâ€™s a
      simple yet flavorful meal that highlights the savory richness of soy sauce
      and the crunch of fresh vegetables or add-ins like peas and carrots. The
      eggs add a creamy, velvety texture that balances the firmness of the rice,
      creating a satisfying bite.

    <p>
      <em>This versatile dish</em> is a great way to repurpose leftover cooked
      rice, turning it into a hearty meal or side dish. The combination of umami
      from soy sauce or oyster sauce, the slight sweetness of vegetables, and
      the savory eggs makes it a well-rounded and delicious meal. You can
      customize it by adding protein like chicken or shrimp or extra vegetables
      for added nutrition and variety.
